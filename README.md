# crazy-readers-diary
A diary for all those crazy readers who wants to write their opinions about what they read and keep it for them, and also to count the books that you read

I'm a crazy reader and I wish I have something where I can keep all my thoughts about a book or a story.

Like a diary :book::pencil:

But nowadays where usually in our computers or in our smartphones that use a real diary becomes an odd action, we have to stop our computer/smartphone activities to write in our diary.
So, my point is to create this virtual diary for all those crazy readers.
